#X text 39 30 The [soundsout] object generates sound output for audio
sample MAMIC objects that work with directly with audio files such
as WAV and AIF formats. Objects that output audio samples include [xboxpad]
and [compk]. [soundsout] comes with a master volume control as well
as reverb (echo) (and length) controls. Infact you have the choice
of four different types of reverb.Simply plug the Audio Output of
an object like [compk] into the Audio input of [soundout]. Program
the [compk] object \, turn up the master volume on [soundsout] \, trigger
the pre oaded audio files in [compk] and you will hear the audio sample
that you have triggered through [soundsout].[soundsout] also comes
with an 'Audio Output' setting \, which connects to the [record] object
which enables you to make an audio file (.WAV) of the sound output
from the [soundsout] object.;
#X text 34 336 1 Open \, and program a MAMIC object that outputs audio
samples like [compk] to send audio output to [soundsout].;
#X text 33 385 2 Connect the Audio Output Outlet of [compk] to the
Audio Input Inlet of [soundsout];
#X text 29 427 3 Cick on the [soundsout] image to see it's control
panel \, and turn up the master volume control.;
#X text 32 468 4 Trigger your audio sample from [compk] and you should
now hear your sound through [soundsout];
#X text 640 103 EXAMPLE belowIn the example below two [soundsout]
are being used. WHich demonstrates that you can use multiple [soundsout]
objects. The [compk] controlled [soundsout] is using reverb whilst
the [xboxpad] [soundsout] is just play the audio files in their original
form.;
