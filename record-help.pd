#X text 678 -6 EXAMPLE belowIn the example below [conductor] is controlling
a G Major scale and two chords.Three patterns are used 1 \, 2 and
3 (look in the pattern editor)Pattern 1 controls [majorscale] by
sending sequence numbers 1 - 8 these represent each scale degree.Pattern
2 controls the chord created in the [makechord 1] object. Every time
the sequence number 16 is sent to [makechord 1] is plays the chord.Pattern
3 controls the chord corted in the [makechord 2] object. Every time
the sequence number 12 is sent to [makechord 2] is plays the chord.3
[voicesout]'s are used to show that you can play multiple [voicesout]
simultaneously. Eac [voicesout] adopts differing voices and reverb
settings;

#X text 39 30 The [record] object makes an audio file (WAVE fromat)
of your overall composition or perfromance and saves it as a wave (WAVE
file). THis can then be played on any muisc device and even be your
ringtone.Simply connect the Audio Output Outlets of each [voicesout]
and/or [soundsout] objects that are in your patch to the [record]'s
Audio Input.You then need to tell [record] were on your computer
you wish to sae your WAV file and name it. Then just ned to tell [record]
how ong in seconds you wish to recod for. Hit the Rec botton to then
start your recording.;
#X text 39 213 Quick Start1 Connect all the Audio Output Outlets
from each [soundsout] and [voicesout] in your patch to [record]'s Audio
input Inlet2 Click the @Save As...' button on [record]. Choose where
to save your WAV file and name is. myrecording.wav for example3 CLick
on the image on [record] to show its contol panel4 Set the number
