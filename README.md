# MAMIC
Hello and welcome to the MAMIC Git


MAMIC is a collation of Pure Data library abstractions and thus a visual programming library for the Pd-L2Ork IDE, specifically designed to give primary school students the chance to create music through maths and visual programming. 

MAMIC aims to:

●	Leverage musical process relating to composition and performance to introduce coding (and visual programming specifically) in an accessible and engaging way.

●	Use musical process to vibrantly introduce mathematical concepts.

●	Reinforce existing mathematical knowledge by making abstract concepts audible and/or visible, and able to be modified in a hands-on way.  

●	Facilitate and support in-the-wild delivery by non-subject-specialists.

●	Run on a wide variety of computers, including on the older and budget-orientated hardware found in many schools, without requiring permanent installation.

<h2>How to Use this MAMIC Library</h2>

Firstly, I recommend you work with MAMIC on Ubuntu-Studio and install the Pd-L2Ork IDE through the ppa here https://launchpad.net/~dr-graef/+archive/ubuntu/pd-l2ork.trusty

Next take the contents of this Git MAMICLibrary and navigate to this folder in Pd-L2Ork as a library path. 

Please then feel free start using the MAMIC abstractions.

Please feel free to add to this project and contribute :)
