Patch 1 – An example of a student patch from case study one, where multiple external human performance input devices are utilised, using the abstractions [xboxpad] and [midikeyboard].

Patch 2 – An example of a student patch from case study one, where the [conductor] abstraction is utilised to control a [makechord] abstraction. Evidence of MAMIC sequence number use and internal sequencing input from the MAMIC library topology model. 

Patch 3 – An example of a student patch from case study two, showing two [makechord] abstractions being triggered by either the [conductor] abstraction or the [webcam] abstraction. This patch was saved using the [opensave] abstraction which activates the MAMIC state saving algorithm.

Patch 4 – An example of a student patch from case study two, showing the [conductor] triggering a [makechord] abstraction. The chord produced by [makechord] is created and heard through the [voicesout] abstraction. This patch was saved using the [opensave] abstraction which activates the MAMIC state saving algorithm.
