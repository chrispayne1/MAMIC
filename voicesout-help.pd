#X text 39 30 The [voicesout] object provides voice (sound) output
for MAMIC objects that work with MIDI number information. Objects that
output MIDI number information include [majorscale] and [makechord].
Currently five voices are available on [voicesout] \, Lead1 \, Lead2
\, Harpischord Xylophone and Xylophone2. [voicesout] also comes with
a master volume control as well as reverb (echo) (and length) and sustain
settings.Infact you have the choice of four different types of reverb.Simply
plug the MIDI output of an object like [majorscale] into te MIDI input
of [voicesut]. Program the [majorscale] object \, send sequence number
informaiton to [majorscale] \, turn up the master volume on [voicesout]
and you will hear the voice you have selected.[voicesout] also comes
with an 'Audio Output' setting tht connects to the [record] object
which enables you to make an audio file (.WAV) of the sound output
from the [voicesout] object.;
#X text 35 364 1 Open \, and program a MIDI Output object (such as
[majorscale] to send MIDI number information to [voicesout].;
#X text 34 413 2 Connect the MIDI Ouput Outlet of [majorscale] to the
MIDI Input Inlet of [voicesout];
#X text 34 457 3 Cick on the [voicesout] image to see it's control
panel \, and select your voice and turn up the master volume control.
;
#X text 36 507 4 Enbale your MIDI Output object ([majorscale] in this
case) to play and you should hear the voice(s) playing through [voicesout].
;
#X text 730 -2 EXAMPLE belowIn the example below [conductor] is controlling
a G Major scale and two chords.Three patterns are used 1 \, 2 and
3 (look in the pattern editor)Pattern 1 controls [majorscale] by
sending sequence numbers 1 - 8 these represent each scale degree.Pattern
2 controls the chord created in the [makechord 1] object. Every time
the sequence number 16 is sent to [makechord 1] is plays the chord.Pattern
3 controls the chord corted in the [makechord 2] object. Every time
the sequence number 12 is sent to [makechord 2] is plays the chord.3
[voicesout]'s are used to show that you can play multiple [voicesout]
simultaneously. Eac [voicesout] adopts differing voices and reverb
settings;
