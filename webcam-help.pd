#X text 41 194 IMPORTANT because [webcam] uses audio files/samples
[soundsout] must be used \, so the sounds can be heard.Also [webcam]
is quite process intensive so results will depend on how powerful your
computer is !;
#X text 41 307 1 Open [webcam] and [soundsout] and connect the audio
output of [webcam] to the audio input of [soundsout];
#X text 42 12 The [webcam] object lets you use your comuter webcam
as a musical instrument. [webcam] gives you four squares in each corner
of your screen. You can attach an audio sample (file) to each of these
squares. When you move in front of a square the audio sample is triggered.
The webcam window opens in a seperate window.The [webcam] squares
work on colour hue so for best results \, use a dark background with
a light trigger.[webcam] also comes with FPS (frames per second)
and sensitivity settings \, to enable you to get good results.;
#X text 41 350 2 Click on the keyboard image on [webcam] to reveal
it's conrol panel;
#X text 41 392 3 Make sure the volumes are turned up on the squares
required (to play to drum kit example turn up the volume levels for
ALL four squares).;
#X text 41 443 4 Turn up the master volume in [soundsout]5 Stand
out of the way of the webcam image to show the backgound. [webcam]
will use the background colours as a reference point to gage movement.6
Click the 'backgound' button on each square to save the backgorund
colours. Rememeber you must NOT be in the image as this point.;
#X text 41 586 7 Wave your hand in front of a square \, your audio
sample should now be triggered.Adjust FPS and sensitivity to get
best results;
#X text 452 59 EXAMPLE below[webcam] has the pre-loaded drum kit
loaded onto ll four webcam squares.[webcam] is plugged into [soundsout]
so when the webcam squares are triggered with movement \, the samples
are triggered which are assigned to each square.;
